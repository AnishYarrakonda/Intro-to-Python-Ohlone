# Intro to Python at Ohlone

Coursework and practice projects from an introductory Python class.

## Contents
- `printMeFirst/`, `fileCounter/`, `menuFunctions/`, `mortgageGui/`, `olympicRings/`, `taxrate/`, `whileLoopInterest/`
- zipped copies of some assignments are also included
- `dictionary/` and `dictionary.zip`

## Running projects
Most projects can be run directly from their folder. Examples:

```bash
python3 menuFunctions/menu_functions.py
python3 fileCounter/file_counter.py
```

If a folder contains multiple scripts, start with the one matching the folder purpose or named like a main script.

## Purpose
This repo is organized as class exercises and small standalone programs rather than one single application.
